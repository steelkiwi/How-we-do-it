#How we do it - public examples of our code

Here you can find some of our open source projects and those which were made "just for fun". Check them to see our codestyle and know more about approaches used.


* https://github.com/steelkiwi/libGDX-Path-Editor

Path editor was developed as an auxiliary utility during the development of our in-house [Grand Park Auto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steelkiwi.grandparkauto) game. We thought it might help other developers to make path creation easy and it really did!

* https://github.com/steelkiwi/AndroidRecording

Audio/video recording solution developed for fun unexpectedly became pretty popular and got lots of GitHub stargazers.

* https://github.com/steelkiwi/Android-Image-Worker-Library

There was a time when image loading/caching on Android was a tricky task and this was our attempt to make world better. Some time after, many good solutions were introduced, but this project stay here as our contribution to open source.
